    "title": "Assessment of Mechanical and Non Destructive Properties of Heavy Density Concrete Subjected to Acid Attack",
    "abstract": "Heavy-density concrete plays a pivotal role in providing structural integrity and radiation shielding in critical infrastructure. However, exposure to acidic environments poses a significant challenge, potentially compromising the material's durability and mechanical properties. This research examines the mechanical and non-destructive properties of heavy-density concrete produced by integrating grit iron scale aggregates as coarse aggregate in concrete and the utilization of silica fume as a supplementary cementitious material. The experiments involve preparing samples using 25% and 50% Heavy Weight Grit Iron Scale (HWGS) Aggregate along with 15% silica fume. Concrete specimens were tested for slump, compressive strength and rebound hammer after 28 days of curing. The water-cured specimens were exposed to 10% of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The findings indicated that concrete containing 25% HWGS exhibited superior acid resistance in comparison to the other concrete mixes while achieving maximum compressive strength.",

    "title": "Guided wave localization and quantification of actual corrosion damage in metallic pipelines considering environmental factors",
    "abstract": "Abstract Corrosion damage is a primary cause of pipeline failure, and guided waves are conventionally employed for non-destructive testing purposes. However, the intricacy of authentic corrosion damage and environmental factors (EFs) complicate the quantitative evaluation of corrosion damage by guided waves. In this paper, four metal pipes with different degrees of corrosion were prepared by accelerated corrosion experiments over a period of 30 days, and a guided wave localization method for pipeline corrosion damage considering EFs and a corrosion degree quantification method based on the change of guided wave velocity are proposed. These methods utilize the interaction between the propagation characteristics of guided waves and corrosion damage, while taking into account the interference caused by EFs, and reduce the influence of EFs on the localization and quantitative assessment of corrosion damage by extracting features that are sensitive to corrosion damage. The experimental findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving precise corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment of the degree of corrosion. The relative errors in corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment were found to be 6.28% and 9.38%, respectively. The methods provided in this paper offer new solutions for the detection of corrosion damage in metallic pipelines in real engineering.",

Developed through accelerated corrosion experiments, these methods demonstrated high precision, achieving relative errors of 6.28% for localization and 9.38% for quantitative assessment, thus offering practical solutions for real-world pipeline inspection."

    "title": "Research on the Hyperspectral-based Unmixing Model of Composite Pigments on Mural Surfaces",
    "abstract": "Abstract. Murals constitute an invaluable component of cultural heritage, encapsulating profound artistic and historical significance. Hyperspectral remote sensing, as a non-destructive testing technique, offers an effective means for analysing and identifying mural pigments. We proposed a spectral unmixing method based on the negative logarithm of spectral reflectance, aimed at improving the accuracy of quantitative analysis for composite pigments in murals. We obtained three sets of mixed spectra: cinnabar-orpiment, azurite-orpiment, and azurite-malachite. The original reflectance was converted into negative logarithmic values, and linear models were applied for unmixing. Supervised unmixing was conducted in the experiment to evaluate the model’s precision, with the unmixing process carried out using known endmembers. The unmixing accuracy was quantified using the Root Mean Square Error, which compares the estimated abundances of all endmembers with actual values. Additionally, a comparison was made between the negative logarithmic transformation and the commonly used transformations of original reflectance, first derivative, and second derivative. The result show that the logarithmic hyperspace linear model simplifies spectral unmixing complexity, enhancing the accuracy of linear unmixing models in addressing mixed pigment unmixing problems. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for real murals, the improved model was applied to the hyperspectral data unmixing analysis of murals collected by the Yungang Academy, located in Shanxi Province, China. Experimental findings demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, the improved unmixing approach more precisely represents the pigment distribution in the murals. This study offers new ideas and methods for the digital preservation and restoration of mural composite pigments.",

    "title": "Deep Residual Learning for Hyperspectral Imaging Camouflage Detection with SPXY-Optimized Feature Fusion Framework",
    "abstract": "Camouflage detection in hyperspectral images remains challenging due to the high spectral similarity between artificial materials and natural vegetation. This study aimed to develop a non-destructive classification framework for distinguishing camouflage fabrics from natural grass based on reflectance data within the 389.06-1005.10 nm range. The workflow involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed using ENVI software for dimensionality reduction, followed by Standard Normal Variate (SNV) transformation, Savitzky–Golay(SG) filtering, first-order derivative processing, and Z-score normalization. The Sample set Partitioning based on joint X-Y distance (SPXY) algorithm was utilized to enhance sample representativeness. Six classification models were constructed, including PCA, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Residual Neural Network (ResNet). The SPXY-ResNet model achieved the highest classification performance, with an accuracy of 99.17%, a precision of 98.89%, a recall of 98.82%, and an F1-score of 98.82%. Model calibration under different sampling strategies was evaluated using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, mean similarity, and standard deviation of similarity. Results indicated that the SPXY algorithm improved distributional consistency between training and testing sets, thereby enhancing generalization performance. The confusion matrix revealed only two misclassifications among 120 test samples, indicating strong classification reliability. Convergence curves further confirmed stable training behavior, with no signs of overfitting. These results demonstrate that the proposed SPXY-ResNet framework offers accurate and robust performance for camouflage detection in complex spectral environments.",
