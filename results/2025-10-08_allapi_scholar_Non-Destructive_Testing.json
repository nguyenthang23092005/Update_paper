    "title": "Evaluation of One-image 3D Reconstruction for Plant Model Generation",
    "abstract": "Generating accurate and visually realistic 3D models of plants from single-view images is crucial yet remains challenging due to plants' intricate geometry and frequent occlusions. This capability matters because it supplements current plant datasets and enables non-destructive, high-throughput phenotyping for crop breeding and precision agriculture. More broadly, 3D reconstruction is particularly important because plant morphology is inherently three-dimensional, while 2D representations miss occluded leaves, branching geometry, and volumetric traits. However, plants present unique challenges compared to common rigid objects, and most current generative methods have not been systematically tested in this domain, leaving a gap in understanding their reliability for realistic plant reconstruction. This study systematically evaluates six advanced generative techniques—Hunyuan3D 2.0, Trellis (Structured 3D Latents), One2345++, InstantMesh, Direct3D and Unique3D—using the existing PlantDreamer dataset. Specifically, this research reconstructs mesh models from images of Bean plants and quantitatively assesses each method’s performance against ground-truth scans using Chamfer Distance, Normal Consistency, F-Score, PSNR, LPIPS, and CLIP Score. The paper also presents qualitative results of Kale and Mint plants. The results indicate that Hunyuan3D 2.0 achieves superior performance overall, suggesting its effectiveness in capturing complex plant structures. This work provides valuable insights into strengths and limitations of contemporary 3D generative approaches, guiding future improvements in realistic plant digitisation.  3D plant reconstruction  image-conditioned generation  diffusion models  plant digitisation  PlantDreamer dataset  single-image reconstruction  ## Full Text  ## Additional Declarations  Cite  Share  [Download PDF](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7577309/v1.pdf?c=1759765166000)  ### Status:  Under Review  ![Plant Methods](https://assets-eu.researchsquare.com/logos/journals/logo-plant-methods-m.svg)  ### Version 1  posted 06 Oct, 2025  - Reviewers agreed at journal    01 Oct, 2025  - Reviews received at journal    01 Oct, 2025  - Reviewers agreed at journal    29 Sep, 2025  - Reviewers agreed at journal    28 Sep, 2025  - Reviewers invited by journal    22 Sep, 2025  - Editor assigned by journal    12 Sep, 2025  - Submission checks completed at journal    12 Sep, 2025  - First submitted to journal    09 Sep, 2025   You are reading this latest preprint version  ### Citations  See more  ### Engagement  8 views  ### Comments  0",

    "title": "Rapid Post-Earthquake Estimation of Vibration Frequencies of Historical Masonry Structures Using Laser Doppler Vibrometry",
    "abstract": "It is challenging to conduct operational modal analysis of structures using contact sensors (e.g. accelerometers) in post-earthquake reconnaissance studies due to safety concerns. This paper presents the use of Laser Doppler Vibrometry as a safe and practical non-contact alternative to detect vibration frequencies of historical masonry structures. A single point Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) was used to collect ambient vibration data from historical masonry structures after the 2023 Kahramanmaras earthquakes. The velocity measurements for a single-span arch bridge and a historic church are analysed in the frequency domain to identify the vibration modes of the examined structures. The vibration frequencies are used to evaluate, and where necessary update, the 3D finite element models created from point cloud data and non-destructive material tests. The results highlight the potential of LDV to provide practically useful data for conducting forensic post-earthquake investigations.",

    "title": "Determining the Properties of a Layered Composite Plate Made of Twill-Weave Glass Fibre Fabric Using Non-Destructive Testing Methods",
    "abstract": "A non-destructive method for determining the properties of laminated composite materials made of twill-weave glass fibre fabric is considered. To determine the elastic characteristics of the composite monolayer, a combined numerical–experimental method is used. The method combines the results of experimental tests and numerical modelling methods using optimization techniques. Firstly, the method for determining the properties is tested in a virtual experiment to determine the influence of the elastic characteristics of the material that do not affect the frequency response. The adequacy of the approximation equations and the influence of elastic constants on frequency response are evaluated using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Using the results obtained, the properties of the elastic characteristics of layered composite plates made of twill-weave glass fibre fabric using vacuum infusion are determined. To compare the properties obtained from the dynamic calculation, a series of static measurements of tensile samples were carried out. The results showed that the elastic modulus from the static test and the flexural test do not coincide by 4% and 23%, respectively. The technique demonstrates high accuracy and applicability for the non-destructive determination of dynamic material properties in engineering practice.",

However, the intricacy of authentic corrosion damage and environmental factors (EFs) complicate the quantitative evaluation of corrosion damage by guided waves. In this paper, four metal pipes with different degrees of corrosion were prepared by accelerated corrosion experiments over a period of 30 days, and a guided wave localization method for pipeline corrosion damage considering EFs and a corrosion degree quantification method based on the change of guided wave velocity are proposed. These methods utilize the interaction between the propagation characteristics of guided waves and corrosion damage, while taking into account the interference caused by EFs, and reduce the influence of EFs on the localization and quantitative assessment of corrosion damage by extracting features that are sensitive to corrosion damage. The experimental findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving precise corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment of the degree of corrosion. The relative errors in corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment were found to be 6.28% and 9.38%, respectively. The methods provided in this paper offer new solutions for the detection of corrosion damage in metallic pipelines in real engineering.

    "summary": "Corrosion damage is a primary cause of pipeline failure, and while guided waves are used for non-destructive testing, accurately quantifying this damage is challenging due to complex corrosion patterns and environmental factors. This study proposes novel guided wave methods for both localizing and quantifying corrosion damage in metallic pipelines, specifically designed to account for environmental influences and utilizing changes in guided wave velocity. These methods leverage the interaction between guided wave propagation and corrosion, effectively reducing environmental interference by extracting corrosion-sensitive features. Experimental validation demonstrated the method's efficacy, achieving precise localization and quantification with relative errors of 6.28% and 9.38% respectively, offering practical solutions for real-world pipeline inspection."

    "title": "Robust Industrial Surface Defect Detection Using Statistical Feature Extraction and Capsule Network Architectures",
    "abstract": "Automated quality control is critical in modern manufacturing, especially for metallic cast components, where fast and accurate surface defect detection is required. This study evaluates classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms using extracted statistical parameters and deep learning (DL) architectures including ResNet50, Capsule Networks, and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN3D) using 3D image inputs. Using the Dataset Original, ML models with the selected parameters achieved high performance: RF reached 99.4 ± 0.2% precision and 99.4 ± 0.2% sensitivity, GB 96.0 ± 0.2% precision and 96.0 ± 0.2% sensitivity. ResNet50 trained with extracted parameters reached 98.0 ± 1.5% accuracy and 98.2 ± 1.7% F1-score. Capsule-based architectures achieved the best results, with ConvCapsuleLayer reaching 98.7 ± 0.2% accuracy and 100.0 ± 0.0% precision for the normal class, and 98.9 ± 0.2% F1-score for the affected class. CNN3D applied on 3D image inputs reached 88.61 ± 1.01% accuracy and 90.14 ± 0.95% F1-score. Using the Dataset Expanded with ML and PCA-selected features, Random Forest achieved 99.4 ± 0.2% precision and 99.4 ± 0.2% sensitivity, K-Nearest Neighbors 99.2 ± 0.0% precision and 99.2 ± 0.0% sensitivity, and SVM 99.2 ± 0.0% precision and 99.2 ± 0.0% sensitivity, demonstrating consistent high performance. All models were evaluated using repeated train-test splits to calculate averages of standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and processing times were measured, showing very low per-image execution times (as low as 3.69×10−4 s/image), supporting potential real-time industrial application. These results indicate that combining statistical descriptors with ML and DL architectures provides a robust and scalable solution for automated, non-destructive surface defect detection, with high accuracy and reliability across both the original and expanded datasets.",

    "abstract": "## Highlights  **What are the main findings?**  - An X-ray beam tracking phase-contrast imaging system based on a conventional X-ray source was experimentally demonstrated.  - The method maintains high sensitivity under large focal spot conditions and enables the extraction of phase gradient information.   **What is the implication of the main finding?**  - The system can be implemented under standard laboratory conditions.  - It shows promising potential for nondestructive imaging of low-density, weakly absorbing, or biological materials.    To address the issue of insufficient contrast in conventional X-ray absorption imaging for biological soft tissues and weakly absorbing materials, this paper proposes a beam tracking X-ray phase-contrast imaging system using a conventional X-ray source. A periodic pinhole array mask is placed between the X-ray source and the sample to spatially modulate the X-ray beam, dividing it into multiple independent sub-beams. Each sub-beam is deflected due to the modulation effect of the sample, resulting in slight positional shifts in the intensity patterns formed on the detector. The experiments employ an X-ray source with a 400 μm focal spot and use a two-dimensional step-scanning approach to acquire image sequences of various samples. The experimental results show that this method can extract the edge profile and structural changes in the samples to some extent, and it demonstrates good contrast and detail recovery under weak absorption conditions. These results suggest that this method has certain application potential in material inspection, non-destructive testing, and related fields.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a beam tracking X-ray phase-contrast imaging system, utilizing a conventional X-ray source, to address the low contrast of traditional X-ray absorption imaging for biological soft tissues and weakly absorbing materials. The system employs a periodic pinhole array mask to spatially modulate the X-ray beam, allowing for the detection of subtle deflections caused by the sample and enabling the extraction of phase gradient information. Experimentally demonstrated even with a large focal spot, this method maintains high sensitivity and effectively recovers contrast and detail in weakly absorbing samples. This technology offers a promising, laboratory-implementable solution for nondestructive imaging of low-density, weakly absorbing, or biological materials."

    "title": "Self-Powered Triboelectric Vibration Sensor for Non-Destructive Density Evaluation of Metal 3D-Printed Parts",
    "abstract": "In this study, a self-powered triboelectric vibration sensor (TVS) was designed and fabricated to enable non-destructive evaluation of the density of metal 3D-printed specimens. The developed TVS employed a rigid glass substrate combined with an aluminum friction electrode and an electrospun PVDF-TrFE nanofiber layer, which together established a contact-separation-based triboelectric conversion mechanism. The nanofiber layer, characterized by its high porosity and flexibility, was engineered to increase the effective contact area and enhance the sensing sensitivity, while also functioning as a structural cushion to improve mechanical durability.  Using this sensor, the vibration attenuation characteristics of metal 3D-printed specimens with different densities (10%, 60%, and 100%) were measured. Under test conditions of 200 Hz frequency and 50 µm amplitude, the results demonstrated a clear linear correlation between the specimen density and the degree of vibration attenuation. The relationship between the TVS output voltage and specimen density was quantified with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.984, confirming the feasibility of accurate density estimation.  These findings indicate that the triboelectric sensor can be extended beyond conventional energy harvesting applications into a practical sensing platform capable of industrial use in structural health monitoring and quality assessment of 3D-printed components. Furthermore, this study provides a concrete example of how TENG technology can contribute to broader commercialization and adoption by demonstrating low-cost, battery-free, and lightweight advantages that enable deployment across diverse industrial settings.

    "abstract": "Mauddud formation is one of the most prominent formations in Northeastern Iraq due to its significant hydrocarbon reserves, making accurate geomechanical characterization essential for safe drilling operations and informed development planning. This study constructs a calibrated post-drill one dimensional mechanical earth model (1D-MEM) for selected wells, levering Techlog software to integrate rock mechanical data, image logs, multi-arm caliper measurements, conventional well logs, drilling reports, and core analyses. The methodology provides a detailed workflow for estimating geomechanical properties from log and image analysis to model calibration. Validation of the 1-D MEM performed through cross-comparison with direct measurements, ensuring the reliability of the predicted stress and strength profile. Laboratory and field data including pore pressure measurements using DST method, destructive and non-destructive mechanical tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thin section test (TS), X-ray diffraction test (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) have all been used for analyzation and calibration process. These datasets enhance the MEM parameters and support the derivation of empirical correlation specific to the Mauddud Formation. Derived correlations include compressional-shear slowness velocity, slowness velocity- bulk density, compression slowness-unconfined compressive strength (UCS), and the Young's modulus to UCS correlation. Results show that mineralogical composition particularly porosity and calcite content have a dominant influence on formation strength with high porosity, low calcite intervals resulting in the lowest UCS values.

    "abstract": "Heavy-density concrete plays a pivotal role in providing structural integrity and radiation shielding in critical infrastructure. However, exposure to acidic environments poses a significant challenge, potentially compromising the material's durability and mechanical properties. This research examines the mechanical and non-destructive properties of heavy-density concrete produced by integrating grit iron scale aggregates as coarse aggregate in concrete and the utilization of silica fume as a supplementary cementitious material. The experiments involve preparing samples using 25% and 50% Heavy Weight Grit Iron Scale (HWGS) Aggregate along with 15% silica fume. Concrete specimens were tested for slump, compressive strength and rebound hammer after 28 days of curing. The water-cured specimens were exposed to 10% of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The findings indicated that concrete containing 25% HWGS exhibited superior acid resistance in comparison to the other concrete mixes while achieving maximum compressive strength.

The MBR was fabricated using the soften-and-compress technique on standard SMF-28 silica fibre, creating a bottle-shaped structure with controlled bottle diameter, stem diameter, and bottle length. A tapered microfiber with a 2 µm waist diameter was used for coupling, enabling the resonator to achieve a high quality factor (Q > 1.5×10⁵), confirming its low-loss performance and strong field confinement. Honey samples with concentrations ranging from 10% to 60% were analysed. The MBR sensor demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.0824 dB/% with excellent linearity of 97%, while wavelength-shift analysis showed an additional sensitivity of 4.0 pm/%. The sensor exhibited stable and repeatable responses across multiple experimental cycles and short-term stability tests. Compared with conventional techniques such as refractometry, FTIR, and electrochemical methods, the MBR offers significant advantages in compactness, non-destructive measurement, and sensitivity. These findings establish the MBR as a reliable platform for honey quality monitoring and authenticity testing, with potential for broader food and industrial sensing applications.",

    "title": "Investigation of surface welding discontinuities in EN AW 5083 HO aluminum plates joined by robotic GMAW butt welding using non-destructive testing methods",
    "abstract": "This study aims to systematically investigate the superficial weld discontinuities that may occur after welding 1.75 mm thick EN AW 5083 HO aluminum alloy sheets, known for their high corrosion resistance due to elevated magnesium content, using a butt joint configuration and the Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) technique. The ultimate objective is to identify optimal welding parameters to enhance the structural integrity and service reliability of aluminum weldments, particularly for marine engineering applications. In the experimental phase, EN AW 5083 HO aluminum sheets were prepared and robotically welded using GMAW under varying welding currents and travel speeds. Following the welding process, non-destructive testing methods—including visual test (ISO 17637), liquid penetrant testing (ISO 3452–1), and radiographic examination (ISO 17636–1)—were conducted to detect surface and subsurface discontinuities. The acquired data were used to identify, categorize, and quantitatively assess weld imperfections such as porosity, incomplete fusion, bead irregularities, and surface cracking. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlation between welding parameters and discontinuity occurrence, leading to the identification of the most effective parameter set for minimizing weld discontinuities. The results revealed a strong dependency of discontinuity formation on welding current and travel speed: elevated current and improper feed rates significantly increased porosity and fusion discontinuities. Conversely, the optimized parameter set substantially reduced surface discontinuity rates and improved overall weld bead quality. All findings were evaluated in accordance with the acceptance criteria defined in ISO 5817 for aluminum welds.

    "summary": "This study investigated superficial weld discontinuities in Gas Metal Arc Welded (GMAW) EN AW 5083 HO aluminum alloy sheets, aiming to optimize welding parameters for enhanced structural integrity, particularly in marine engineering. Researchers robotically welded sheets under varying currents and travel speeds, then employed non-destructive testing (visual, liquid penetrant, radiographic) to identify and quantitatively assess imperfections like porosity, incomplete fusion, and cracking. The results demonstrated a strong correlation between welding parameters and discontinuity occurrence, revealing that elevated current and improper feed rates significantly increased defects. An optimized parameter set was identified, which substantially reduced surface discontinuities and improved overall weld bead quality, meeting ISO 5817 acceptance criteria."

However, developing high-performance near-infrared emitting materials with broad spectral output remains challenging due to limitations in excitation compatibility, quantum efficiency, and material stability. In this study, \\[(Mo6I8)I6\\]2− (Mo6) cluster-doped (ETP)2SbCl5 0D metal halide glass through a low-temperature liquid quenching method is synthesized. X-ray diffraction results indicate that Mo6 cluster doping does not disrupt the amorphous structure of the glass. Optical properties show that broadband NIR emission is achieved under blue light excitation, with internal and external quantum efficiencies reaching 85% and 75%, respectively. Time-resolved spectroscopy and temperature-dependent photoluminescence analysis elucidate the energy transfer process and the mechanism of high internal quantum efficiency. The glass exhibits excellent resistance to singlet oxygen quenching in the solid state, and the Mo6-doped material also shows advantages in solution processing for optoelectronic device fabrication. Moreover, (ETP)2SbCl5:Mo6 glass demonstrates good NIR emission performance under various excitation modes and in different states. When packaged into NIR phosphor-converted light-emitting diode (pc-LED), it shows excellent spectral stability and outstanding practical application performance in bioimaging, night vision, non-destructive testing, and plant growth.  ## Conflict of Interest  The authors declare no conflict of interest.  ## [Open Research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lpor.202501665\\#)  # Data Availability Statement  The data that support the findings of this study are available in the supplementary material of this article.  ## Supporting Information  | Filename | Description | | --- | --- | | [lpor70476-sup-0001-SuppMat.pdf](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Flpor.202501665&file=lpor70476-sup-0001-SuppMat.pdf) 1.3 MB | Supporting Information |  Please note: The publisher is not responsible for the content or functionality of any supporting information supplied by the authors.

Infrared thermography is an effective technique for detecting internal defects in materials. However, traditional detection methods depend on manual inspection, which suffers from several limitations, including low efficiency, relatively high false detection rates, and slow processing speed. These shortcomings hinder their ability to meet the demands of industrial applications. This study proposes an model of Infrared Non-destructive Testing - You Only Look Once V11(INDT-YOLOV11 )rapid object detection model. Based on YOLOV11n, we present a VSP-C3k2 module incorporating variant spatial pooling to mitigate noise interference during feature fusion. The SaE mechanism from SENetV2 is integrated with the C2PSA module to form a SaE-C2PSA attention mechanism, enhancing defect feature representation. To improve detection speed, the original backbone network in YOLOV11n is replaced with a MobileNetV2 feature extraction network. A dataset containing bubbles and delamination defects was established using Infrared Non-destructive Testing(INDT) based on halogen lamp to capture infrared thermal images. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with YOLOV11n, the proposed INDT-YOLOV11 model achieves 20.85% and 20.75% improvements in mAP50 and mAP50-90 metrics respectively, while reducing parameter count and computational load by approximately 38.59% and 39.06%. On GTX1050 hardware, INDT-YOLOV11 achieves 31.5 FPS with 23.05% speed enhancement. And INDT-YOLOV11 has achieved almost the same mAP50 as YOLOV8-worldv2 and YOLOX lightweight models with minimal parameter and computational complexity, making it highly competitive in models such as YOLO-SA，providing effective technical support for automated internal defect detection in 3D-printed carbon fiber composite components.   ![](https://static.iopscience.com/3.98.0/img/cc-by-nc-nd.png)  During the embargo period (the 12 month period from the publication of the Version of Record of this article), the Accepted Manuscript is fully protected by copyright and cannot be reused or reposted elsewhere.

Pressure Vessel Technol.  Search  [Advanced Search](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/pressurevesseltech/search-results)   Corrosion damage is a primary cause of pipeline failure, and guided waves are conventionally employed for non-destructive testing purposes. However, the intricacy of authentic corrosion damage and environmental factors (EFs) complicate the quantitative evaluation of corrosion damage by guided waves. In this paper, four metal pipes with different degrees of corrosion were prepared by accelerated corrosion experiments over a period of 30 days, and a guided wave localization method for pipeline corrosion damage considering EFs and a corrosion degree quantification method based on the change of guided wave velocity are proposed. These methods utilize the interaction between the propagation characteristics of guided waves and corrosion damage, while taking into account the interference caused by EFs, and reduce the influence of EFs on the localization and quantitative assessment of corrosion damage by extracting features that are sensitive to corrosion damage. The experimental findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving precise corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment of the degree of corrosion. The relative errors in corrosion damage location and quantitative assessment were found to be 6.28% and 9.38%, respectively. The methods provided in this paper offer new solutions for the detection of corrosion damage in metallic pipelines in real engineering.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of accurately localizing and quantifying corrosion damage in metallic pipelines using guided waves, considering the complexities of actual corrosion and environmental factors. It proposes novel guided wave methods for both localization and quantification, which are based on changes in guided wave velocity and designed to mitigate environmental interference. These methods leverage the interaction between wave propagation and corrosion, extracting features sensitive to damage. Experimental validation on corroded pipes demonstrated high accuracy, achieving relative errors of 6.28% for localization and 9.38% for quantification. This research offers effective solutions for practical pipeline corrosion detection in real-world engineering scenarios."

    "title": "Optical Fiber Device for Non-Destructive Detection of Water Concentration in Ethanol",
    "abstract": "The widespread use of ethanol in various industries requires low-cost, handheld devices to identify the purity standard of ethanol rapidly, especially its water concentration, in a non-destructive way. A portable and low-cost optical device is demonstrated in this paper to detect different concentrations of water in ethanol. The results of the near-infrared (NIR) spectral study of the ethanol-water samples show a significant change in reflectivity at around 1300 nm wavelength. Therefore, the demonstrated device consists of a 1300 nm light emitting diode (LED), a USB optical power meter, and a fiber reflection probe. The performance of the device is tested by preparing samples of different volume percentages of water in ethanol. The sensitivity of the device is found to be 0.0021 µw per 1% (v/v) water in ethanol. The device can resolve a change of 1% (v/v) water in ethanol accurately by monitoring the reflected light at 1300nm from the samples. It detects water concentration ranging from 0% to 100% (v/v) non-destructively, and the measurement speed of the demonstrated device is 4 ms. The repeatability of the measurements and long-term stability of the sensor device are verified through repeated and reversed tests. The cost of the device is 3.5k USD, and it can be used for continuous and remote measurements without destroying the sample or the fiber device. The advantages of the demonstrated device, such as low cost, eco-friendliness, good sensitivity, repeatability, wide concentration range of operation, non-destructive testing, and rapid measurement, make it suitable for commercialization.",

    "abstract": "### Background  The current understanding of strain-induced martensitic transformation in AISI 304L stainless steel lacks comprehensive non-destructive testing (NDT) for effective monitoring, limiting the ability to assess phase transformation in industrial applications.  ### Objective  This study aims to develop and evaluate NDT methods for monitoring strain-induced martensitic transformation in AISI 304L stainless steel.  ### Methods  The research employs direct microscopic analyses, including optical microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), alongside indirect NDT techniques such as microhardness testing, magnetic permeability measurements, and eddy current (EC) sensor inductance evaluations. Novel aspects include the integration of these methods to correlate phase transformation with measurable properties.  ### Results  The study finds that the martensitic phase fraction increases significantly beyond 25 % strain, with inductance and permeability showing strong correlations with phase transformation. Tensile and equibiaxial tests indicate that inductance measurement is a promising tool for monitoring transformations in complex geometries, while microhardness reflects material hardening but lacks direct correlation with phase transformation.  ### Conclusions  The findings support EC sensor measurements as a robust method for NDT applications in assessing strain-induced transformations in stainless steel from lab specimens to complex components.

    "title": "Heterostructure engineering of rod-like Bi2S3/Bi2Se3 composites for high-sensitivity direct X-ray detection with ultra-low detection limit",
    "abstract": "Direct X-ray detection technology, enabled by its rapid response, high special resolution and simple system configuration, has witnessed widespread applications in medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing and scientific research. This drives the need for high-performance X-ray detection materials aiming for high sensitivity and low detection limits. Sulfides face significant challenges in X-ray detection performance due to the low atomic number of sulfur, intrinsic defects such as sulfur vacancies, and surface oxidation susceptibility. Herein, a series of rod-like clustered Bi2S3/Bi2Se3 composites with tunable S/Se molar ratios were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Precise control of Se incorporation effectively modulated the morphology of nanorod-assembled Bi2S3 clusters, enhancing their structural and optoelectronic properties. Notably, the optimized Bi2S3-8% Se composite exhibited enlarged dimensions and denser nanorod clusters, leading to significantly improved X-ray detection performance. Under 40 kV X-ray irradiation, detectors based on Bi2S3-8% Se pellets achieved a remarkable sensitivity of 1025.37 μC·Gyair-1·cm-2, representing 3.5 times higher than pure Bi2S3. Furthermore, its detection limit was drastically reduced to 130 nGyair·s-1. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of Bi2S3/Bi2Se3 heterostructures, which facilitate efficient charge separation and transport, thereby boosting X-ray photoconversion efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of Bi2S3/Bi2Se3 composites as high-performance direct X-ray detectors, offering a promising strategy for developing advanced radiation detection materials.

    "abstract": "Desiccation cracking in clay soils severely impacts the geotechnical engineering and environmental control by altering the soil strength, water infiltration, and structural stability. The application of traditional evaluation methods, such as observation and grid mapping, is commonly used to evaluate the fissures resulting from desiccation, tensile stress, and environmental factors. These techniques are inaccurate and not scalable. New advances in crack detection, including X-ray Computed Tomography (X-Ray CT), Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR), Digital Image Correlation (DIC), and Machine Learning (ML), have enabled the performance of high-resolution, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) of the surface and subsurface cracks. New techniques enhance the uses in slope stability assessment, soil liner integrity inspection, and water management. However, their potential shortcomings, such as expensive implementation and enormous computational needs, limit their extensive application. Emerging technologies, including the real-time inspection by Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques and neural networks, offer much potential.

    "title": "Synergistic effects of montmorillonite and rubber aggregates on concrete properties",
    "abstract": "This study explores the potential of montmorillonite (MT) nanoclay to improve the physical, mechanical, durability, and microstructural properties of rubberized concrete. The inclusion of recycled crumb rubber (CR) as a partial fine aggregate replacement supports environmental sustainability but often compromises strength and durability due to weak interfacial bonding with the cementitious matrix. To address this limitation, MT nanoclay was used as a partial cement replacement at levels of 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%, while CR was incorporated at 5%, 10%, and 15% by volume of fine aggregate. Concrete specimens were evaluated for workability, compressive, tensile, and flexural strength. Durability performance was assessed under acid attack, chloride penetration, and elevated temperature conditions. Non-destructive tests such as ultrasonic pulse velocity and rebound hammer were conducted to determine structural integrity. Microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to investigate matrix densification, pore refinement, and hydration behavior. The results demonstrated that the addition of MT nanoclay significantly enhanced the mechanical performance and durability of rubberized concrete. SEM analysis revealed improved interfacial bonding and increased calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) gel formation, contributing to reduced porosity and better internal structure. Enhanced non-destructive test values further confirmed the improved quality of the concrete matrix. Overall, the use of MT nanoclay proved effective in offsetting the drawbacks of rubber incorporation, offering a viable and sustainable solution for producing high-performance concrete suitable for environmentally conscious construction applications.  ### Explore related subjects  Discover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.  - [Building Materials](https://link.springer.com/subjects/building-materials) - [Calcium-based cement](https://link.springer.com/subjects/calcium-based-cement) - [Concrete](https://link.springer.com/subjects/concrete) - [Structural Materials](https://link.springer.com/subjects/structural-materials) - [Materials Engineering](https://link.springer.com/subjects/materials-engineering)  [Use our pre-submission checklist](https://beta.springernature.com/pre-submission?journalId=44416)  Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript.",

A key challenge in optimizing their performance is the impedance mismatch between the piezoelectric elements and the surrounding medium, which significantly affects energy transmission efficiency. Traditional matching layers, such as quarter-wavelength ($\\\\lambda/4$) structures, enhance transmission around a specific frequency but suffer from narrow bandwidth limitations. To address this issue, broadband matching layers with gradually varying acoustic impedance have been proposed. In this study, we introduce a new broadband matching layer design based on Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS), specifically utilizing primitive unit cells with a quasi-exponential density variation along the wave propagation direction. These structures can be easily designed with a continuously varying material distribution and efficiently fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques. We develop finite element models of the proposed designs, which demonstrate high efficiency in terms of energy transmission, showing a clear improvement in the transmission coefficient compared to conventional solutions. Additionally, our acoustic numerical results indicate that the number of unit cells significantly influences the presence of frequency band gaps. This characteristic could be leveraged to design matching layers that selectively block specific frequency ranges.   ![](https://static.iopscience.com/3.98.0/img/cc-by.png)  As the Version of Record of this article is going to be / has been published on a gold open access basis under a CC BY 4.0 licence, this Accepted Manuscript is available for reuse under a CC BY 4.0 licence immediately.

    "summary": "Ultrasonic transducers are limited by impedance mismatch, which traditional matching layers struggle to address with sufficient bandwidth. This study introduces a novel broadband matching layer design based on Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) featuring a quasi-exponential density variation. These structures offer advantages in design flexibility and efficient fabrication through additive manufacturing. Finite element models confirm that the proposed TPMS-based layers significantly enhance energy transmission efficiency and can be engineered to create frequency band gaps for selective blocking."

    "abstract": "One of the most important solutions for producing sustainable concrete is the utilization of old concrete as coarse aggregate. This study evaluates the full replacement of coarse aggregate with recycled aggregate and the impact of micro steel fibers on the mechanical properties of concrete using a combination of non-destructive and destructive tests. The deployed methodology includes five concrete mixes incorporating 0%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, and 1% micro steel fibers by volume to produce sustainable concrete reinforced with fibers. The non-destructive tests examined density, Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV), and dynamic modulus of elasticity, while the destructive tests examined compressive strength, static modulus of elasticity, splitting tensile strength, and flexural strength. The results demonstrate the possibility of adopting zero-cost coarse aggregate produced from old concrete as a sustainable aggregate. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of concrete are enhanced by adding micro steel fibers. The optimal performance was observed at 0.8 % fibers with maximum improvements of 15 % in compressive strength, 39.2 % in splitting tensile strength, and approximately 85 % in flexural strength at 28 % days. The UPV and density values exhibited strong correlations with the compressive strength. Finally, the findings of this study support that the recycled aggregate and micro steel fibers can be used to produce sustainable concrete for modern constructions.",

However, current assessment methods either involve destructive testing that depletes valuable biospecimens or rely on manual evaluations, which are not scalable and lead to interindividual variation. To overcome these challenges, we present PathQC, a deep learning framework that directly predicts the tissue RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and the extent of autolysis from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images of normal tissue biopsies. PathQC first extracts morphological features from the slide using a recently developed digital pathology foundation model (UNI), followed by a supervised model that learns to predict RNA Integrity Number and autolysis scores from these morphological features. PathQC is trained on and applied to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) cohort, which comprises 25,306 non-diseased post-mortem samples across 29 tissues from 970 donors, where paired ground truth RIN and autolysis scores were available. Here, PathQC predicted RIN with an average correlation of 0.47 and an autolysis score of 0.45, with notably high performance in Adrenal Gland tissue (R=0.82) for RIN and in Colon tissue (R=0.83) for autolysis. We provide a pan-tissue model for the prediction of RIN and autolysis score for a new slide from any tissue type ( [GITHUB](https://github.com/Cranjit9/PathQC)). Overall, PathQC will enable scalable measurement of molecular and physical integrity from routine H&E images, thereby enhancing the quality of both biobank generation and its retrospective analysis.  ### Competing Interest Statement  The authors have declared no competing interest.

    "title": "Enhancing Pipeline Safety: Integrating Non-destructive Testing and IoT for Leak Prevention and Detection",
    "abstract": "Pipeline infrastructure dependability and integrity are essential for water distribution, gas, and oil sectors. Pipeline leaks and structural flaws can cause serious environmental harm, financial loss, and public safety risks. This project aims to increase pipeline integrity by preventing leaks and detecting them early on with a coordinated strategy. Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques are utilized to evaluate the strength of pipelines and identify material fatigue or corrosion before breakdowns arise. Examples of these techniques include radiography and ultrasonic testing. Wireless IoT Sensor Nodes continuously monitor pressure, flow rate, and temperature along the pipeline for real-time leak identification. They then transfer the collected data for analysis to a cloud-based platform. An application-based dashboard that provides real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and alarm notifications incorporates all the data gathered. With the help of this program, users can see the health of their pipelines, get alerts when there may be leaks, and take preventative measures. Through the integration of IoT sensors for leak detection and NDT for structural integrity, this solution improves pipeline safety, operational effectiveness, and preventive maintenance.

    "title": "Microwave imaging for human brain stroke detection using frequency domain inverse modelling &amp; phantom experiments",
    "abstract": "This paper reports a study exploring microwave Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging of biological specimens, with the longer-term goal of assessing its applicability for non-invasive and non-destructive imaging of the human brain in the context of stroke detection and monitoring. The paper describes the design and fabrication of a laboratory testbed developed to examine the feasibility of the ISAR approach. The system includes a custom antenna designed to reduce self-generated clutter and support the imaging process. Water was used as a matching medium due to its specific permittivity-frequency relationship, providing controlled conditions for experimental evaluation. The forward and inverse models were initially tested in simulated environments, and subsequently evaluated using physical measurements on real biological specimens in a bistatic radar configuration, to assess their ability to localize internal anomalies with sub-centimetre resolution across a 26 cm circular imaging area. The reconstructed images from vegetable phantoms such as potatoes and turnips suggest the technique may be capable of detecting internal structural variations. These preliminary findings serve as a foundation for future investigations into human brain imaging applications.  ### Similar content being viewed by others  ![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-022-20944-8/MediaObjects/41598_2022_20944_Fig1_HTML.png)  ### [Microwave brain imaging system to detect brain tumor using metamaterial loaded stacked antenna array](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20944-8?fromPaywallRec=false)  ArticleOpen access01 October 2022  ![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44172-023-00156-2/MediaObjects/44172_2023_156_Fig1_HTML.png)  ### [A high-resolution handheld millimeter-wave imaging system with phase error estimation and compensation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-023-00156-2?fromPaywallRec=false)  ArticleOpen access05 January 2024  ![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44172-024-00259-4/MediaObjects/44172_2024_259_Fig1_HTML.png)  ### [An experimental system for detection and localization of hemorrhage using ultra-wideband microwaves with deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-024-00259-4?fromPaywallRec=false)  ArticleOpen access05 September 2024",

    "abstract": "The quality parameters of quail eggshells find extensive utility in studies of production efficiency and basic biology. Non-destructive evaluation methods are of particular relevance. Herein, we developed a non-destructive technology for assaying such shell characteristics as shell strength ( _F_), thickness ( _T_), and weight ( _W_ _s_). Studies were conducted using 176 eggs laid by 11-month-old quails from a resource population of F2 crossbreds. The main set of measured and calculated parameters included egg weight ( _W_), volume ( _V_), and surface area ( _S_). In addition, we determined an indicator of elastic shell deformation under a non-destructive load of 0.5 kg ( _δ_ 0.5). Use of this parameter set allowed us to make the most accurate non-invasive prediction of the values of _F_ ( _R_ = 0.756), _T_ ( _R_ = 0.266), and _W_ _s_ ( _R_ = 0.450) for quail eggs. As a result of comparative analysis of the current and previously obtained equations for calculating _W_ _s_, the disadvantages of using empirical equations were also identified. Herewith, we proposed the so-called _index approach_ to forming mathematical dependences, simplifying their further use, for example, in breeding studies. As such, we selected the following conditionally called indices: _metabolism index_ ( _S_/ _V_) and _specific elastic shell deformation_ ( _δ_ 0.5/ _W_). Following the approximation, more convenient and compact dependences were produced. The correlation coefficients between the true and computed values were 0.749 for predicting _F_, 0.262 for _T_, and 0.443 for _W_ _s_, with corresponding RMSE values equal to 0.416 for _F_, 0.019 for _T_, and 0.105 for _W_ _s_. The established index representation of empirical equations will serve as a crucial instrument for eggshell quality control and application in quail breeding.  ## Conflicts of Interest  The authors declare no conflicts of interest.  ## [Open Research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfpe.70219\\#)  # Data Availability Statement  The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.",

    "summary": "This study developed a non-destructive method to assess quail eggshell strength, thickness, and weight, which are important quality parameters. Researchers used various egg measurements, including elastic deformation under a light load, to accurately predict these shell characteristics, especially shell strength. An innovative \"index approach\" was introduced, utilizing derived indices like metabolism and specific elastic deformation, to simplify the predictive mathematical models. This non-destructive technology and its simplified index representation provide a valuable tool for eggshell quality control and application in quail breeding programs."
