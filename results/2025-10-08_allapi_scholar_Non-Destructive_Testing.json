    "abstract": "Abstract Near‐infrared (NIR) light sources have found extensive applications in bioimaging of biological tissues, plant growth, disease diagnosis, and therapeutics. However, developing high‐performance near‐infrared emitting materials with broad spectral output remains challenging due to limitations in excitation compatibility, quantum efficiency, and material stability. In this study, [(Mo 6 I 8 )I 6 ] 2− (Mo 6 ) cluster‐doped (ETP) 2 SbCl 5 0D metal halide glass through a low‐temperature liquid quenching method is synthesized. X‐ray diffraction results indicate that Mo 6 cluster doping does not disrupt the amorphous structure of the glass. Optical properties show that broadband NIR emission is achieved under blue light excitation, with internal and external quantum efficiencies reaching 85% and 75%, respectively. Time‐resolved spectroscopy and temperature‐dependent photoluminescence analysis elucidate the energy transfer process and the mechanism of high internal quantum efficiency. The glass exhibits excellent resistance to singlet oxygen quenching in the solid state, and the Mo 6 ‐doped material also shows advantages in solution processing for optoelectronic device fabrication. Moreover, (ETP) 2 SbCl 5 :Mo 6 glass demonstrates good NIR emission performance under various excitation modes and in different states. When packaged into NIR phosphor‐converted light‐emitting diode (pc‐LED), it shows excellent spectral stability and outstanding practical application performance in bioimaging, night vision, non‐destructive testing, and plant growth.",

    "title": "Evaluation of One-image 3D Reconstruction for Plant Model Generation",
    "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Generating accurate and visually realistic 3D models of plants from single-view images is crucial yet remains challenging due to plants' intricate geometry and frequent occlusions. This capability matters because it supplements current plant datasets and enables non-destructive, high-throughput phenotyping for crop breeding and precision agriculture. More broadly, 3D reconstruction is particularly important because plant morphology is inherently three-dimensional, while 2D representations miss occluded leaves, branching geometry, and volumetric traits. However, plants present unique challenges compared to common rigid objects, and most current generative methods have not been systematically tested in this domain, leaving a gap in understanding their reliability for realistic plant reconstruction. This study systematically evaluates six advanced generative techniques—Hunyuan3D 2.0, Trellis (Structured 3D Latents), One2345++, InstantMesh, Direct3D and Unique3D—using the existing PlantDreamer dataset. Specifically, this research reconstructs mesh models from images of Bean plants and quantitatively assesses each method’s performance against ground-truth scans using Chamfer Distance, Normal Consistency, F-Score, PSNR, LPIPS, and CLIP Score. The paper also presents qualitative results of Kale and Mint plants. The results indicate that Hunyuan3D 2.0 achieves superior performance overall, suggesting its effectiveness in capturing complex plant structures. This work provides valuable insights into strengths and limitations of contemporary 3D generative approaches, guiding future improvements in realistic plant digitisation.",

    "title": "Rapid Post-Earthquake Estimation of Vibration Frequencies of Historical Masonry Structures Using Laser Doppler Vibrometry",
    "abstract": "It is challenging to conduct operational modal analysis of structures using contact sensors (e.g. accelerometers) in post-earthquake reconnaissance studies due to safety concerns. This paper presents the use of Laser Doppler Vibrometry as a safe and practical non-contact alternative to detect vibration frequencies of historical masonry structures. A single point Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) was used to collect ambient vibration data from historical masonry structures after the 2023 Kahramanmaras earthquakes. The velocity measurements for a single-span arch bridge and a historic church are analysed in the frequency domain to identify the vibration modes of the examined structures. The vibration frequencies are used to evaluate, and where necessary update, the 3D finite element models created from point cloud data and non-destructive material tests. The results highlight the potential of LDV to provide practically useful data for conducting forensic post-earthquake investigations.",

    "title": "Determining the Properties of a Layered Composite Plate Made of Twill-Weave Glass Fibre Fabric Using Non-Destructive Testing Methods",
    "abstract": "A non-destructive method for determining the properties of laminated composite materials made of twill-weave glass fibre fabric is considered. To determine the elastic characteristics of the composite monolayer, a combined numerical–experimental method is used. The method combines the results of experimental tests and numerical modelling methods using optimization techniques. Firstly, the method for determining the properties is tested in a virtual experiment to determine the influence of the elastic characteristics of the material that do not affect the frequency response. The adequacy of the approximation equations and the influence of elastic constants on frequency response are evaluated using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Using the results obtained, the properties of the elastic characteristics of layered composite plates made of twill-weave glass fibre fabric using vacuum infusion are determined. To compare the properties obtained from the dynamic calculation, a series of static measurements of tensile samples were carried out. The results showed that the elastic modulus from the static test and the flexural test do not coincide by 4% and 23%, respectively. The technique demonstrates high accuracy and applicability for the non-destructive determination of dynamic material properties in engineering practice.",
